We have bulit-in middle ware function 
and also we can creat own middle ware function 

bascially when a request is coming from cilent to server , it has to pass many middleware , this called request processing pipeline.

There are some example of bulitin middleware like 

app.use(express.json()) ; // yeh jab request as a json file aa rahi h tho ushe read karke req.body mai daal deta h 

second is 
app.use(express.urlencoded()) // this is also a bulit-in middleware 
// yeh thab kaam karta h jab values form mai bhar kar aa rahi h ho like
// key1=value&key2=value&key3=value
// yeh link bane kar tab aati h jab hum form mai response fill kar server ko send kar rahe ho 


app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended : true}))
// yeh uper wale ka baap h isme sab aa jaayge like array aa raha ho request mai ishe
