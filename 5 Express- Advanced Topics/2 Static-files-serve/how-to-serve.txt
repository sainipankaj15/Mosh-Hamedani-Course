ishe file mai static karke ek folder h usme statics file hi rakhi hui h 

statics file ka means wo h jo files hum bina kis k bakchodi k cilent tak pucha deni h 
like .css file 
and .txt file and documents 
and file which we dont have to public 

so using statics you have to write in you app.js is

app.use('/static', express.static('static'));  // serving static file 
// static is the folder name and some people use it as a public so dont be confuse
